# Matrix-Multiplication-Performance-Analysis-Using-Sequential-MPI-OpenMP-and-CUDA
This project analyzes the performance of matrix multiplication implemented using four approaches—Sequential C, MPI for distributed parallelism, OpenMP for shared-memory parallelism, and CUDA for GPU acceleration—to compare execution efficiency across computing models.
